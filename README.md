Simulation for the ZDC, built for CMSSW_7_5_0

Changes in the conditions of the simulation are made in pgZDC_RPD_730.py

Entering "cmsRun pgZDC_RPD_730.py" will produce the file simevent.root. 

Entering "cmsRun ZdcSimHitStudy_cfg.py" will then produce an output for ZDC Validation. The hits and energies in the ZDC channels should be stored there. 

The final output will be called something like DQM_V0001_R000000001__Global__CMSSW_X_Y_Z__RECO.root.
